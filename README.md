# About me
My name is Grzegorz Juszczak. I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. 
I have a master's degree in Power Engineering. At the moment I work as an electrical installations designer. 
Recently I got interested in software testing and made a decision to change my profession.
In December 2020 I began Software Tester training course at Software Development Academy and completed it in March 2021. 
My next step is to obtain ISTQB FL certification. I will take the exam on 21th April, 2021.
At the same time, my goal is to further develop my testing knowledge, technical skills and as a result, became software tester. 
On this site I present my experience gained during the course and the self-studies and researches.
