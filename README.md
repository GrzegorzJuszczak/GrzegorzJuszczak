# About me
My name is Grzegorz Juszczak. I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. 
I have a master's degree in Power Engineering. Through 5+ years' experience as an Electrical Installations Designer 
I gained excelent communication skills, accuracy and attention to details. 
I became interested in IT testing and made a decision to change my profession which resulted 
in completing the Software Tester practical course and obtaining ISTQB Foundation Level certificate. 
I currently work as a Test Automation Enginner and additionally in my free time 
I develop my skills by doing online courses and working on small projects which are listed below.
